# DSCR Calculator & Guide

A conversational tool for real estate investors to understand and calculate Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR).

## What is DSCR?

DSCR measures whether a rental property's income covers its loan payments. Lenders use it to qualify investors for DSCR loans—mortgages based on property cash flow, not your personal income.

## What This Tool Does

- Helps you calculate your property's DSCR
- Explains what goes into the formula
- Answers questions about DSCR loan requirements
- Guides you through the numbers lenders care about

## Who It's For

Real estate investors exploring DSCR loans for:
- Single-family rentals
- Small multifamily (2-4 units)
- Short-term rentals

## How to Use

Just start a conversation. You can:
- Ask questions ("What DSCR do lenders require?")
- Request a calculation ("Can you help me figure out my DSCR?")
- Explore scenarios ("What if I do interest-only?")

The assistant will ask for the inputs it needs.
